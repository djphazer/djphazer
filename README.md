### âš¡ Pew! Pew! Pew! âš¡

Hi there! My name is Nick. ðŸ‘‹

My interests lie at the intersection of **Music** and **Math**. My skillset ranges from **Computer Science** to **Audio Engineering** to **Industrial Manufacturing**, spanning nearly two decades of experience. My passion for music and entertainment has inevitably persisted through it all - collegiate a cappella, hip-hop music production, DJing dance music as well as weddings and other events.

Recently, I've graduated from simply making music to hacking on software/firmware tools for making music. The next phase might be making more documentation videos about my music tools, so I have an excuse to show off the music I've made with them! ;-P

If you appreciate what I'm doing and can afford to help subsidize my existence, consider my internet tip jar at [**DJPhazer.com**](https://djphazer.bandcamp.com/) - name your price for a variety of Boxed Beatz!
