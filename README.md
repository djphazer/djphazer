### âš¡ Pew! Pew! Pew! âš¡

Hi there! My name is Nick. ðŸ‘‹

I love **Music** and **Math**. I have skills in **Computer Science**, **Audio Engineering**, and **Industrial Manufacturing**, from nearly two decades of experience.
My endless passion for music and entertainment drove me to try collegiate a cappella, music production, and DJing dance music for weddings and other events.

Recently, I've graduated from simply making music to hacking on software/firmware tools for making music. The next phase might be making more documentation videos about my music tools, so I have an excuse to show off the music I've made with them! ;-P
